            My name is Jerome Hardaway, and I am a hopeful Developer Advocate for Quicken Loans. After leaving the Air Force at the
          height of the recession, I retooled myself to become a programmer. While seeing others struggle post-service, I thought
          to myself, " If it worked for me, it would work for them." So I started teaching other veterans remotely how to program.
          To date, I have helped over 250 veterans connect and learn this crazy alchemy where we tell the computer what to do
          called web development. While holding down a job and performing the duties assigned to me, I have been a fierce advocate
          for training veterans for today's skills NOW, not later, while leading from the front and pushing troops to become
          better versions of themselves and to master the tools of the digital age.
        </p>

          <p>
            I have performed talks at conferences like OSCON, had the opportunity to write for Stack Overflow, and podcasted as a
            host on Ruby Rogues. I have showcased the ability to not only educate but entertain while bringing a level of realism
            into the industry that only one who has seen the world from its worsts views and still found the silver lining can.
          </p>
          <p>
            Front End Architecture, CSS, and Design Sytems make me happy. I hope in the future to lead teams on building front ends
            that make other programmers envious while helping the business with its goals. The web is a little boring with the
            coolest toys saved for portfolios. I believe that the world is ready for some spice on the internet, and I hope to one
            day be the one able to serve it to them without constraints. I find CSS therapeutic, and the idea of making it scalable
            for large teams excites me.
          </p>

            I am on FIRE for Javascript as I told WIRED Magazine, its the working man's language. While accessible to all, it's so
            wonky and unforgiving that anything can happen. Its the MMA of programming and I love it. I think because, like the
            military, it has demanded my blood, sweat, and tears.
          </p>
          <p>
            When I am not writing, speaking, teaching, coding, or learning, I'm a family man. I have a wife, three boys and three
            dogs, all who I am sure are going to be the death of me.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you asked me today why I am the best person for this job, my answer would be simple: right now, I am in the Georges
            St. Pierre phase of my career. I can add value to the super technical programmers, educate managers and newbies alike,
            and still hungry to learn and have so much more to value to give the community and help teams become great. So let's do
            this.
