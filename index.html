      I am a hopeful Developer Advocate for Quicken Loans. After leaving the Air Force at
      the
      height of the recession, I retooled myself to become a programmer. While seeing others struggle post-service, I
      thought
      to myself, " If it worked for me, it would work for them." So I started teaching other veterans remotely how to
      program.
      To date, I have helped over 250 veterans connect and learn this crazy alchemy where we tell the computer what to do
      called web development. While holding down a job and performing the duties assigned to me, I have been a fierce
      advocate
      for training veterans for today's skills <b>NOW</b> , not later, while leading from the front and pushing troops to become
      better prepared for the current workforce by mastering the tools of the digital age.

      I have performed talks at conferences like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-Lpvz8yQMI">OSCON</a>, had the opportunity to write for <a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2020/01/11/hello-world-want-to-be-a-developer-learn-how-to-learn/">Stack Overflow</a>, and podcasted as a
      host on Ruby Rogues. I have showcased the ability to not only educate but entertain while bringing a level of realism
      into the industry that only one who has seen the world on its worst days and still found the silver lining.

      Front End Architecture, CSS, and Design Systems make me happy. I hope in the future to lead teams on building front
      ends
      that make other programmers envious while helping the business with its goals. The web is a little boring with the
      coolest toys saved for portfolios. I believe that the world is ready for some spice on the internet, and I hope to one
      day be the one able to serve it to them without constraints. I find CSS therapeutic, and the idea of making it
      scalable
      for large teams excites me.

        I am on ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ for Javascript as I told <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/why-we-love-tech-better-humans/">WIRED Magazine</a>, its the working man's language. While accessible to all, it's so
        wonky and unforgiving that anything can happen. Its the MMA of programming and I love it. I think because, like the
        military, it has demanded my blood, sweat, and tears.

        When I am not writing, speaking, teaching, coding, or learning, I'm a family man. I have a wife, three boys and three
        dogs, all who I am sure are going to be the death of me.

          If you asked me today why I am the best person for this job, my answer would be simple: right now, I am in the Georges
          St. Pierre phase of my career. I can add value to the super technical programmers, educate managers and newbies alike,
          and still hungry to learn and have so much more to value to give the community and help teams become great. So let's
          do
          this.

          This is a small beginning of a javascript app I am building for Vets Who Code, where I gather the data of a cohort then export it into a csv file.
           Doing this allows me to transfer data to our less technical board members and our sponsors for their records. Guthub Repo is <a href="https://github.com/jeromehardaway/devrel">here</a>.
